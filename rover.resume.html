<section id="Bio">
<h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>My name's Kelly. I moved to Boston from San Francisco to get my Master's in Publishing & Writing at Emerson. I'm an avid walker and photographer, and I enjoy having a furry friend come along with me as I adventure the city and get to know the area. I work remotely for an online publication where I write and edit articles on all things "fandon." In my free time, I enjoy reading, collaging, crocheting, and drawing. I like to stay busy and I especially like the company of a furry friend.<br> I am also fluent in Italian and can get by with Spanish.</p>

<h2>Pet Experience</h2>
<p>Before moving to college I rescued Cisca, an elegant indoor cat in her middle age, and Tyler, a six month old Cockapoo, whom I trained. Once Tyler was well trained we added my neighbors sweet middle aged Frenchie Chihuahua mix, Henley, on our walks. While living in San Francisco I walked dozens of doggos over the years. I have always had a strong affinity to animals and have great respect for them, in all their individualities. I accept a level of parenting involved in handling animals and understand there are some pets with certain boundaries to be respected. I am very eager to get to know all the different furry friends that live in and around the city.</p>

          <td>"Kelly took excellent care of our dog Cleo, and of our home! She sent frequent photo updates of Cleo and left our home organized/tidy upon our return. Cleo was clearly very happy all weekend and we knew she was in great hands. We would highly recommend booking with Kelly for house sitting/petsitting."</td>
          <td>"Kelly was an amazing cat sitter! She watched our cat Milo for over a week, and we felt super comfortable and happy with our decision. She was really nice and communicative leading up to the stay. During the stay, she sent us so many pictures, and it was clear Milo was being well taken care of. She stayed in our home during the house sitting and was a very respectful guest. I would definitely book with Kelly again!"</td>
          <td>"Kelly was amazing! She took great care of my dog and he had no anxiety when I got home, which is amazing. She stayed in my house which was so helpful and she even vacuumed which was so not necessary but extremely kind. Will definitely be booking with Kelly again in the future and I recommended her to a few friends locally!"</td>
